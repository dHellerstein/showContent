## showContent is semi-deprecated!
   We recommend using the wsurvey.floatingContent.js, which is part of the wsurvey.lib repository.
   [a wsurveyLIb] (/wsurvey.lib) 
   
# showContent
Javascript libraries to create moveable &amp; resizable dynamically updated containers.

Three are two javascript libraries in this repository

  a) wsMoveBoxes.js :  convert an existing container (such as a div) into  a moveable/resizeable "box".
  b) wsShowContent.js : uses wsMoveBoxes to create a moveable/resizable "box". You then write content to its "header" bar, or "content" area.

Both of these use jQuery.

A number of features  are supported, including:
  a) Update and move using mouse clicks. Not quite full implementation of an internal window -- several icons (i.e.; arrows in the corner) are used (rather then 
    clickingon an edge)
  b) Maximizing the container to fill the window, and unmaximize
  c) Hide the container, and show an icon to redisplay it.
  d) Scroll up/down and left/right icons can be displayed in the heder.

Each library has an extenstive documentation (in a .txt file). And a few example .html files are also provided..
